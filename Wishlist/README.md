This codes create a layout where users can see their wishlist items. Include options to remove items from the wishlist and maybe even add them to the cart directly.

This JavaScript code dynamically renders wishlist items and adds event listeners to the remove and add to cart buttons. The removeItemFromWishlist function removes the item from the wishlist array and re-renders the wishlist items. You can customize the functionality inside the "Add to Cart" button handler as needed.
